Hi!
My name is Christian. I'm wrestling a phd in phsyics and enjoy sailing.

I hope you'll find the content here interesting. 
The purpose of this blog is to provide some longevity and documentation to a few of the ideas I come up with. I occasionally run into very nice examples of python code, that I will try to show as well.

In my research I work on terahertz generation with femtosecond lasers, and that also tends to spark some ideas that are not solid enough for publication or patenting, but are still interesting to some communities. 

I also reckon' it'll be nice to have somewhere to leave clever snippets of code, that are not suited for their own repository. 


Cheers!
